# CitiBike Analysis 

**[CitiBike Analysis Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dante.salgado/viz/CitiBike_16630262447970/CitiBikeSharingAnalysis?publish=yes)**

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze the data from NYC Citibike to determine what could be expected if a similar bike sharing system was created in Des Moines. This analysis only looked at the month of August because it is a busy time for the prpgram as it is summer and it is a very popular destination for turists. 

## Results

As NYC is a big city with many citizens and trourists, it is important to knwo what the most popular places in the city are where people rent the bikes. This graph shows us just that with blue dots. The darker and bigger the circle is, the more popular the bikes are. On the other hand, the darker the red color is, the less popular they are in that area or station.

This graph indicates the time of the day when bikes are in use, giving us a good idea of when people rent bikes in the month of August, one of the busiests times of the year in the city. This can also give us a great picture of when we can do maintenacnce on the bikes that need it, without affecting profits.

After looking at the busiest time of the day, it is also important to know how long bikes are in use for. This graph shows us that most trips only last 5 minutes.

If we look at the checkout times by gender, we see that males are the group of people that use the bikes more often and for longer.

This graph shows us the bike usage during the days of the weeks and the time when they are being used. Times before and after usual work hours being the most popular for users to rent bikes.

Males and females tend to use the bikes about around the same time, with males using them more often, as stated before.

This graph gives us a clear view of the amount of usage the bikes get between subscribers and costumers, with subscribers being the main people that use the bikes. 

## Summary

The analysis gives us a great look into what to expect if this program is taken to Des Moines. We can expect more males to use the bikes before and after regular working hours during the weekdays and they will be subscribers. Because of this, I would recommend doing a similar program where there is a subscription model as it tends to be more successful then a costumer model with both males and females.

HAving said that, I would recommend doing more research into what the program would look like in Des Moines such as what reas would be the most popular for residents and tourists to use, what hours are the most popular apart from rush hours as the city might not have as many tourists as NYC or places open after certain hours, and finally, what are the expected number of users in order to figure out if Des Moines would actually be a profitable city or not for this kinds of programs.
