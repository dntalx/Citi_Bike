## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze the data from NYC Citibike to determine what could be expected if a similar bike sharing system was created in Des Moines. This analysis only looked at the month of August because it is a busy time for the prpgram as it is summer and it is a very popular destination for turists.
